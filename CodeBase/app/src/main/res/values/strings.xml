1. Ensure your profile information (name, email, phone) is accurate and up to date. This is how organizers will contact you.\n\n
2. You may only join the waiting list once per event. Duplicate entries will be removed to ensure fairness.\n\n
3. Joining a waiting list does not guarantee selection. Entrants are randomly chosen after the registration period ends.\n\n
4. If you are selected ("win" the lottery), confirm or decline your spot promptly to allow others a fair chance.\n\n
5. Enable notifications in your profile view to stay informed about event results and updates.\n\n
6. Respect event rules, organizers, and other entrants. Harassment or misuse of the app will result in removal.\n\n
7. If you need to cancel or update your participation, do so as soon as possible.\n\n
8. Always verify event details, such as time and location, before attending.\n\n
9. Participate responsibly and enjoy the community events fairly!
